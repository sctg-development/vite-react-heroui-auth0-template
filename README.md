## Authentication with Auth0

This template uses the Auth0 React SDK to provide an authentication layer. Below are the steps to set up and configure Auth0 for this project.

### Setting Up Auth0

1. **Create an Auth0 Account:**
   - Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Create a New Application:**
   - In the Auth0 dashboard, navigate to the "Applications" section.
   - Click on "Create Application".
   - Choose a name for your application.
   - Select "Single Page Web Applications" as the application type.
   - Click "Create".

3. **Configure Application Settings:**
   - In the application settings, you will find your `Client ID` and `Domain`.
   - Set the "Allowed Callback URLs" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).
   - Set the "Allowed Logout URLs" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).
   - Set the "Allowed Web Origins" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).

### Environment Variables

To keep your Auth0 credentials secure, use environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```env
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
```

### GitHub secrets

For using the provided GitHub Actions workflows, you need to add the following secrets to your repository:

```env
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
```

## Internationalization

This template uses i18next for internationalization. The configuration and available languages are defined in the `src/i18n.ts` file.

### Adding a New Language

To add a new language to the application, follow these steps:

1. **Update the `availableLanguages` array:**
   - Open the `src/i18n.ts` file.
   - Add a new object to the `availableLanguages` array with the following properties:
     - `code`: The ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., "en-US").
     - `nativeName`: The native name of the language (e.g., "English").
     - `isRTL`: Whether the language is right-to-left (e.g., `false`).

2. **Create a Translation File:**
   - In the `src/locales/base` directory, create a new JSON file named with the language code (e.g., `en-US.json`).
   - Add the translations for the new language in this file.

3. **Update the Load Path:**
   - In the `src/i18n.ts` file, manually add a switch case to the `loadPath` function to handle the new JSON file for the added language.

### Language Switch Component

The `LanguageSwitch` component allows users to switch between the available languages. It is defined in the `src/components/language-switch.tsx` file.

- The component uses the i18n instance to change the language and update the document metadata.
- It automatically updates the document direction based on the language (left-to-right or right-to-left).
- The selected language is stored in `localStorage` to persist the user's preference.

### Example Usage

To use the `LanguageSwitch` component in your application, simply include it in your JSX:

```tsx
<LanguageSwitch availableLanguages={[{ code: "en-US", nativeName: "English", isRTL: false, isDefault: true },{ code: "fr-FR", nativeName: "FranÃ§ais", isRTL: false }]} />
```

or more simply using the `availableLanguages` array defined in the `src/i18n.ts` file:

```tsx
import { availableLanguages } from "@/i18n";
<LanguageSwitch availableLanguages={availableLanguages} />
```

This component will render a dropdown menu with the available languages, allowing users to switch languages easily.

### Lazy Loading

The default configuration uses the `i18next-http-backend` plugin for language lazy loading. This means that translations are loaded only when needed, improving the application's performance.

### Summary

- **Configuration:** `src/i18n.ts`
- **Translations:** `src/locales/base`
- **Language Switch:** `src/components/language-switch.tsx`

By following the steps above, you can easily add new languages and manage internationalization for your application.

## Tailwind CSS 4

This template uses Tailwind CSS 4, which is a utility-first CSS framework. You can customize the styles by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file.  
Currently HeroUI uses Tailwind CSS 3, but [@winchesHe](https://github.com/winchesHe)  create a port of HeroUI to Tailwind CSS 4, you can find it [here](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui/pull/4656), HeroUI packages are available at <https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui/pull/4656#issuecomment-2651218074>.

## How to Use

To clone the project, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sctg-development/vite-react-heroui-template.git
```

### Manual chunk splitting

In the `vite.config.ts` file, all `@heroui` packages are manually split into a separate chunk. This is done to reduce the size of the main bundle. You can remove this configuration if you don't want to split the packages.

### Install dependencies

You can use one of them `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, Example using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using `pnpm`, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@heroui/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.
